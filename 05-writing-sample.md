I am a big fan of Angular! I know it's all about React these days, but I feel with Angular's move into component architecture that it's going to make quite the comback. I'm also a new kid on the block so I like the idea of a full MVC framework. 

##Reasons to Love 

1. Two way data binding is quite neat and can add a lot of cool functionality for the user
2. I enjoy that bindings happen in the attributes. Angular is already watching things for you! I enjoy writing less code that is clean and easier for other developers to read.
3. I also like the separations of concerns that help when writing tests

##Reasons to be Wary

1. Angular apps can become quite cumbersome, and if you're not implmenting a component architectue it seems that it would make apps difficult to scale. 
2. It takes some time to actually get an application started, ie Hello World
3. It can take apps quite some time to render due to DOM manipulation (Hoping Angular 2 improves this)
